Flashcard13
===========
This is a flashcard program for the Android. The program begins with a view of the decks. At
first, this will be empty. The user can then add decks. Once the decks are created, the user
can edit or delete them by pressing and holding.

A user can examine the set of cards by selecting a deck. At this point, he or she can sort the
cards by date created, percentage correct, or alphabetically by selecting the option in the top
right of the screen.

To examine individual cards, the user can pick them from out of the list. The user can then look
at the front of the card, and press on the card to look at the back. On the back, the user can
select if his guess was correct or incorrect, and the strength of the card will increase or
decrease accordingly.
